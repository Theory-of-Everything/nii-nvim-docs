# Philosophy

nii-nvim is a neovim config centered around these three design aspects:
 - Minimalism & Simplicity
 - Small codebase
 - Extensibility These three aspects are the driving ideas of nii-nvim and are
   what taken into consideration with every commit, pull request, and codebase
   change.

## Minimalism/Simplicity 
This pillar the core idea which nii-nvim is built on.
Simplicity and minimalism helps keep focus on what is strictly necessary, no
large libraries, no unnecessary code.

## Small Codebase 
A Small codebase is very important for understanding and
maintaining this project. A small codebase has a smaller chance for bugs and
issues to persist unnoticed and allows easier understanding and work with the
overall codebase.

## Extensibility 
For configurations, extensibility is key, it allows the user
to take what they like add to it. It also allows users to change whatever they
want without issues.
